# Recursive structures in Rust

This project is around playing with smart pointers to implement recursive data structures in Rust. Some classic algorithms will also be implemented.

## TODO

### Reading

- [] Read more about Box, Rc, RefCell, and Cell.
- [] Find some neat algorithms to implement.

### Data structures
- [] Implement a simple linked list using Box.
- [] Implement a simple binary tree using Box.
- [] Implement a simple graph using Box.

### Algorithms

- [] Implement a simple depth-first search algorithm.
- [] Implement a simple breadth-first search algorithm.
- [] Implement a simple Dijkstra's algorithm.
